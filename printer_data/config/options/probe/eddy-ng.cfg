#   Temperature sensor configuration.
#   See the "extruder" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
#smooth_time:
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 2.0 seconds.
#gcode_id:
#   See the "heater_generic" section for the definition of this
#   parameter.
#speed:
#   The travel speed [mm/s] for xy moves during calibration.  Default
#   is the speed defined by the probe.
##horizontal_move_z: 2.5
#   The z distance [mm] from the bed at which xy moves will occur
#   during calibration. Default is 2mm.
##resting_z: 2
#   The z distance [mm] from the bed at which the tool will rest
#   to heat the probe coil during calibration.  Default is .4mm
##calibration_position:
#   The X, Y, Z position where the tool should be moved when
#   probe drift calibration initializes.  This is the location
#   where the first manual probe will occur.  If omitted, the
#   default behavior is not to move the tool prior to the first
#   manual probe.
##calibration_bed_temp: 80
#   The maximum safe bed temperature (in C) used to heat the probe
#   during probe drift calibration.  When set, the calibration
#   procedure will turn on the bed after the first sample is
#   taken.  When the calibration procedure is complete the bed
#   temperature will be set to zero.  When omitted the default
#   behavior is not to set the bed temperature.
##calibration_extruder_temp: 150
#   The extruder temperature (in C) set probe during drift calibration.
#   When this option is supplied the procedure will wait for until the
#   specified temperature is reached before requesting the first manual
#   probe.  When the calibration procedure is complete the extruder
#   temperature will be set to 0.  When omitted the default behavior is
#   not to set the extruder temperature.
##extruder_heating_z: 10.
#   The Z location where extruder heating will occur if the
#   "calibration_extruder_temp" option is set.  Its recommended to heat
#   the extruder some distance from the bed to minimize its impact on
#   the probe coil temperature.  The default is 50.
##max_validation_temp: 100.
#   The maximum temperature used to validate the calibration.  It is
#   recommended to set this to a value between 100 and 120 for enclosed
#   printers.  The default is 60.

[bed_mesh]
horizontal_move_z: 2.0
speed: 200
# For the mesh dimensions below, the coordinates need to be reachable by the center of the probe. To calculate coordinates that will work, use the formula below:
# mesh x min = position_min_x + greater_of (15mm or x_offset) <--- in this term, only consider the x offset if it is positive, ignore if negative.
# mesh y min = position_min_y + greater_of (15mm or y_offset) <--- in this term, only consider the y offset if it is positive, ignore if negative.
# mesh x max = position_max_x - greater_of (15mm or |x_offset|) <--- in this term, only consider the x offset if it is negative, ignore if positive.
# mesh y max = position_max_y - greater_of (15mm or |y_offset|) <--- in this term, only consider the y offset if it is negative, ignore if positive.
# Example: Consider that you have a 300 x 300 bed with the max x and y positions being 300 and the min being 0. Your probe offsets are -20 for X and 10 for Y
# For mesh x min we ignore the x offset term because it is negative. Therefore mesh x min = 15
# For mesh y min we do not ignore the y offset term because it is positive but it is less than 15 so we use 15. Therefore mesh y min = 15
# For mesh x max we do not ignore the x offset term because it is negative. It is also greater than 15. Therefore mesh x max = 280
# For mesh y max we ignore the y offset term because it is positive but it is less than 15 so we use 15. Therefore mesh y max = 285
# The final result would be mesh_min: 15, 15 mesh_max: 280, 285
mesh_min: 20,20 #30, 30  # modify these according to the above guide. If the probe cannot reach then you will get a klipper error when trying to scan a bed mesh.
mesh_max: 330,330 #321, 321 # modify these according to the above guide. If the probe cannot reach then you will get a klipper error when trying to scan a bed mesh.
